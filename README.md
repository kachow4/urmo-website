Hi URMO! This is the 11th Gen website created during the Covid-19 pandemic. This project was created so that people could have more access to info and resources about URMO, but also as a way for all URMO members who are computer science/informatics/design related majors to contribute to the team while everyone was home and interacting remotely. Feel free to clone this website and make a new repository for new generations. Be creative! Make new designs! Share what you think would be the best way to represent URMO through this website structure. If you have any questions about it, please feel free to reach out to me! Happy coding/designing!

Suggestions:
- On the "Meet the Team" page, you can make it so that each square links to a member's personal about page! Have each current gen dancer submit fun facts about them! You can include their year, major, the year they joined, etc. The possibilities are endless!
- Feel free to add more tabs or pages or brighten up the design.
- Update the images and hero images to more current photos to better represent the current gen!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
#I personally use pnpm run dev
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
